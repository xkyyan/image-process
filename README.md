This project implements the RWCRIGF retinal image classification method. Addressing the issue that traditional metrics ignore differences in data information value, it focuses on key regions via the weight function ω(x)=1/x² (where x is the pixel distance from the macular center) and amplifies differences between normal and pathological tissues using high-order feature terms with α=5 and β=5. After preprocessing 6 retinal images (3 normal, 3 pathological, from the Mendeley dataset), quantitative metrics are calculated to effectively distinguish image types. Boasting advantages like key region focus, high discrimination, sensitivity to early lesions, and adaptability to multiple imaging modalities, it provides quantitative support for clinical diagnosis. Though its performance depends on weight function design and requires validation with multi-center data, it holds significant application value.
